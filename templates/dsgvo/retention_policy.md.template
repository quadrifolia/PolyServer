# Data Retention Policy

## Purpose

This policy outlines the principles and guidelines for retaining and deleting personal data processed through our Application analytics platform, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR/DSGVO).

1. **Data Minimization**: We only collect and retain personal data that is necessary for the specified purposes.
2. **Storage Limitation**: We keep personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.
3. **Purpose Limitation**: We use personal data only for the purposes for which it was originally collected.
4. **Security**: We ensure appropriate security for stored personal data throughout its lifecycle.
5. **Accountability**: We document and justify all retention periods for personal data.
