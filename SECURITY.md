# Security Considerations for Application Deployment

This document outlines essential security considerations for your Application deployment, which has access to company data and requires appropriate security measures.

> **Important**: See [SECURITY-ADDENDUM.md](./SECURITY-ADDENDUM.md) for detailed security hardening implementations and [DSGVO.md](./DSGVO.md) for GDPR compliance documentation.

## Security Overview

Your Application instance:
1. Has access to your databases with potentially sensitive information
2. Provides an interface for querying and visualizing this data
3. Requires appropriate security hardening to prevent unauthorized access

## Key Security Measures Implemented

This deployment implements multiple layers of security:

| Security Layer | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------|
| Access Control | SSH key-only authentication, strong passwords |
| Network Security | Firewall (UFW), rate limiting, ModSecurity WAF |
| TLS Encryption | Auto-renewed certificates with HSTS enforcement |
| Container Security | Limited privileges, resource constraints, AppArmor profiles |
| Data Protection | Backups encrypted at rest, secure database connections |
| Monitoring | Netdata metrics, advanced logging, intrusion detection |
| GDPR Compliance | Data breach procedures, subject request handling |

## Security Recommendations

### Authentication

- **Enforce strong passwords** for all Application users (minimum 12 characters)
- **Use SSO integration** when possible for centralized authentication management
- **Regularly review user accounts** and remove unneeded access
- **Enable two-factor authentication** if supported by your Application edition

### Network Security

- **Access Application via VPN** for sensitive deployments
- **Segment your network** to isolate Application and data sources
- **Monitor unusual access patterns** using the provided logging tools
- **Restrict direct database access** to authorized IPs only

### Data Handling

- **Apply data minimization** principles in your analytics
- **Set appropriate view permissions** for different user groups
- **Review data collection consent** for GDPR compliance
- **Implement retention policies** for all data sources

### Incident Response

- Use the provided [DSGVO breach response toolkit](./DSGVO-TOOLS.md)
- **Test incident response procedures** quarterly
- **Maintain backup restore capability** for quick recovery
- **Document all security incidents** using the provided templates
